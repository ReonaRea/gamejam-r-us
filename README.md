# Game Jam Project (Unity 2021.3.21f1)

Welcome to our game jam project! This project is built using Unity 2021.3.21f1 and is a collaborative effort between friends <3. This README will help you get started with the project and understand how to contribute effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Install Git and Unity 2021.3.21f1 if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/gamejam-r-us.git
```

3. Open the project in Unity.

## Contributing

### General Guidelines

1. Create a new branch for your work using the following naming convention:

```bash
<role>/<feature-name>
```

For example: `artist/character-design`, `narrative/story-ideas`, or `programmer/player-movement`.

2. Commit your changes frequently with clear and descriptive messages.
3. When your work is complete, create a pull request and request a review from a team member.
4. After your pull request is approved and merged, remember to delete your branch.

#### Artists

This section is dedicated to guidelines and best practices for artists contributing assets to the project.

##### Getting Started

Create a new branch for your work using the following naming convention:

```bash
artist/<asset-name>
```

For example: `artist/character-design` or `artist/environment-assets`.

##### Asset Guidelines

Save your assets in the appropriate folders under `Assets/Art`. For example, place character assets in `Assets/Art/Characters`, and environment assets in `Assets/Art/Environment`.

Use a consistent naming convention for your assets, such as `AssetType_AssetName_Variant`. For example, `Character_Hero_Idle`, `Environment_Tree_Large`, or `Prop_Chest_Open`.

Optimize your assets for game performance. Keep polygon counts low for 3D models, compress textures appropriately, and avoid using unnecessarily large texture resolutions.
